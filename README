*First Submission of the project containing:
	- Perfect Link
	- Uniform Reliable Broadcast
	- FIFO Broadcast

*It is implemented in Java and has been tested on the test machine which runs Java 1.8.0_191 on a 64-bit architecture.

*With 5 peers broadcasting 100 messages each and the networks being subject to problems (loss, reordering, delay and crash of peers), 
 our program is always able to finish within 20 seconds with no mistakes in the logs. We also tested using more peers and messages and
 the results stays correct as long as the finish time is set according to the number of peers and messages.
